 # About
Inferno is a browser for Android based off of Mozilla's geckoView for Android, Mozilla's Android
 Components, and built from Mozilla's reference-browser. We're not a firefox fork like most other
 browsers, but instead a firefox-based browser using Mozilla's Android Components. Although this
 means more code to write initially, it allows for more customizability while maintaining similarity
 to firefox, and less maintenance in the long term since we don't have to merge with changes made to
 firefox for Android. Hell yeah.

# Upcoming features:
- tabs (finally for firefox-mobile-based apps)
- privacy
  - mozilla telemetry disabled (off by default, can enable if you want to contribute to mozilla's dev team)
- theme (slick ui with lots of preference options)
- lots of customizability in general

that's it for now, hopefully this project doesn't die
