 # About
 Inferno is a browser for Android based off of Mozilla's geckoView for Android, Mozilla's android components, and built from Mozilla's reference-browser.
 
# Upcoming features:
- tabs (finally for firefox-mobile-based apps)
- privacy
  - mozilla telemetry disabled (off by default, can enable if you want to contribute to mozilla's dev team)
- theme (slick ui with lots of preference options)
- lots of customizability in general

that's it for now, hopefully this project doesn't die
